# Server Plugins Setup

### World Edit

To paste the Feather from the schematic file you need the [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) plugin.

Download the the latest version and place the .jar file inside of the `plugins` directory in your server directory.


### Feather Plugin

The Feather uses a custom plugin that I created in order to sync the state between the virtual Feather in Minecraft and the real one plugged in via USB.

Install the FeatherPlugin.jar as well by pasting a copy of it into your `plugins` folder.
